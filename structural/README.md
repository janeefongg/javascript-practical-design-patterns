Concerned with how objects are made up and simplify relationships between objects.

- Deal with the relationship of objects
- Extend functionality/Simplify functionality
- How an object relates to a separate object

##Decorator
Used to add functionality to an existing object, without being obtrusive.

- More complete inheritance
- Wraps an object
- Protects existing objects
