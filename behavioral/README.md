#Behavioral Pattern
Concerned with the assignment of responsibilities between objects and how they communicate.

- Interaction between objects
- Deal with the responsibilities of objects (ex: help objects cooperate with each other)
- Assign clear hierarchy
- Can encapsulate requests

##Observer
Allows a collection of objects to watch an object and be notified of changes

- Allows for loosely coupled system
- One object is the focal point
- Group of objects watch for changes
- Subject knows about everything
